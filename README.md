Cafebazaar In-app purchase Unity plugin


## BUILD INSTRUCTION
To build `BazaarIAB.jar` from the java source code:
1. Open a command prompt
2. Navigate to JavaPlugin folder
3. Type `gradlew createJar`
4. After the build is succeeded you can find `BazaarIAB.jar` in the build folder


## INSIDE UNITY PROJECT
This plugin has not any prefab to use, it will manage the required objects.

The `BazaarIAB` is the interface that let you call billing functions, all methods are static so is it not required to instantiate this class. Before calling any other function try to initialize the plugin by calling the `init` with the public key provided by Cafebazaar developer portal.

This call will check to see if billing is supported and fire the `billingSupportedEvent` if it is. If billing is not supported the `billingNotSupportedEvent` will fire and you should not call any other methods.

There is `IABEventManager` class that you can subscribe to all plugin events.

After you find out that the billing is supported, you can call `queryInventory` by providing all of your available skus. When the `queryInventorySucceededEvent` fires it will contain a list of all the current purchases, subscriptions and a list of all your project sku details. You can use this information to setup your store. The list is also handy when you want to consume a purchase. Any `BazaarPurchases` returned are available for consumption.

Add the plugin activity in the Application section of the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

	<meta-data android:name="billing.service" android:value="bazaar.BazaarIabService" />
	<activity android:name="com.bazaar.BazaarIABProxyActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen" />
	
Also add the required permissions to your manifest:

	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
	<uses-permission android:name="com.farsitel.bazaar.permission.PAY_THROUGH_BAZAAR" />
